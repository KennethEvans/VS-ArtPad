# VS-ArtPad

Windows Performance Viewer is a C# stay-on-top application that provides a customizable keypad for use with pen-based applications such as Photoshop, Painter, Manga Studio, and Rebelle. The problem is that most of these applications rely on a large number of sometimes complicated keystroke sequences to do things in the application. These sequences are hard to enter with the pen. ArtPad allows you to send them by clicking a key which you have set up.
